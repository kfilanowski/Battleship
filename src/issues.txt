ISSUES:

- Not an issue, but we need to incorporate PrintStreamMessageListener in client-side of Battleship
    * It seems that PrintStreamMessageListener is controlling the output. I incorporated it, but it defaults
        to system.out. Unsure of how to change a String argument into a "PrintStream" object.
