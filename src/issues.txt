ISSUES:

- game needs to say who won THEN kick everyone off server or allow players to restart

- issue when a it's a player's turn and that player abruptly quits, the next turn does not go to the next person
  in line (occurs whether it is a regular "/quit" or an abrupt quit).

- Not an issue, but we need to incorporate PrintStreamMessageListener in client-side of Battleship
