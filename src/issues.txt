ISSUES:

- abruptly leaving while in-game does not remove the player from the match.
  (from turns or anything. their grid still exists.)

- game needs to say who won

- game does not end when all players but the last quit


-?? we need to close threads in server when player leaves or w/e. or is that how it even works?
