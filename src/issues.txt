Potential issues we will need to check for, for the sake of robustness:
usernames are valid when players /attack them, or /show them.
users cannot /attack and other certain commands before game starts
check if at least two players exist to play the game.
if the player requests their own grid, it is the private one. (Although I don't see why we can't choose public/private)



Questions:
max number of players?
max grid size?
